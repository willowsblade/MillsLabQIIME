# MillsLabQIIME
Code used by the Mills lab for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis

Files in the archive folder represent earlier versions of the Mills Lab QIIME pipeline, suitable for use with EMP primers

Current files represent the pipeline for use with the V4 region when the orientation of the barcode relative to R1 or R2 is 
unknown.

As the Mills Lab is about to update our 16S sequencing primers to a dual indexing, two-step PCR strategy expect more changes soon.
